 Color Scheme
 We want a familiarity for the user and fans. Using the color scheme from there album Cult Fiction we can create that familiarity. They are bright colors and have the users accessibility in mind.

# Whats on the table?

**The header element** sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down. It contains the navigation links and sticky header would provide a more pleasant UX and adhere to popular conventions better.

**The navigation** will be in the header, having both the the band name and a home button in the header seem to be the industry standard.

**The Cult theme** Is like the hero image in lover running. This will also give the general theme of the website to the user as it is bright colors that contrast with each other. Its from there album Cult ficiton as it has bright contrasting colors and will provide accessablilty to the users.


**The information** on the page is found through the internet from interviews the band had with https://www.breakingtunes.com/cultcalledman and from https://www.postpravdamagazine.com/four-up-coming-irish-acts/?fbclid=IwAR2zmFfPo2vifrUows6bTzwNSGFj-Qgi_5f-ouU0TpY5MJuAkj4jMvGe0FA.

**The Video** is from there youtube channel. The song is from the same album and the song is called Bad seeds. It will be  muted and autoplay will be off, so that we dont irritate the users and also provide a headphone warning before playing. As this is a rock band website it is probably more important to be carefull with users hearing.

**Discography** will be located under the main infromation of the page will link all of the band music from other websites into one easy to mange place.Using anchor tags to link to there bandcamp website and there spotify. It will let the user click and have the bands music avaliable to them. I will be using the bands bandcamp website and Spotify so we can bring all of there music to 1 website.


**Contact** will be an easy to use form people can use if they have questions for the band and I can also include a way to analyse what the fans favorite songs were to find out which of there albums is doing the best.

**Footer** will include there social media links and an all right reserved section for the website.

**Typography** used will be cabin as I think it fits the style of the band, and also san-serif for not compatiable browsers.

# The Actual website
I want to achieve an easy and convient place for people to find all of the bands music and information. I want to tell people of there music by having a discography. I want a brief summary of the band and I want a way to contact them.

Lets start with the header.
![Cult called man header](docs/screenshots/cult-called-man-header.JPG)

This **header** has the navigation and title of the website. Also we have the album Cult Fiction as our hero image. Like in Code Institute love running project. 
We can see the bright colors from the album being used in the website.
I had used 3 html pages but found that the was not enough content to fill 3 separate pages, so I split the pages into 3 sections for the user.

Next we the **information section** of the web page. This has some basic information on the type of music they play and a brief introduction to the band.
![Cult called man informtion](docs/screenshots/Cult-information.JPG)

Again we have a light background with a dark font to allow user accessibility.

**Discography** is a main feature if the website. Again to contrast I used a dark background with a white font. But this has all of there music available in 1 convient place to find there album. A future feature would be to have the music able to play on the website. These are images unlike the other background images, these images will have aria labelled to help improve my score in lighthouse.
We created a grid with help from Youtube. The Youtuber is [Dcodes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnhoY5Cdmy0)

![Cult-discography](docs/screenshots/cult-discography.JPG)

**The contact section** will have a easy lay out that will require the user to enter there name and email address. But also adding checkboxes of the albums can provide a way for the band to analyse which album people like the most and help them find the direction where they want to take there music.
![Cult contact form](docs/screenshots/cult-contact.JPG)

**Footer** will be logos of other social media platforms. These are also aria labelled like the images in the discography and all links are working.

# Tech used 

 For this project I used HTML and CSS.

 I used code from Dcode from youtube to make a grid for the discography. 

 I used Google fonts [cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin?query=cabin) for the style of the writing. 

 I used font awsome [script for footer](https://fontawesome.com/kits/0f96215e04/use) social media links as this seem to be the standard with websites.

 I used [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/jpg-to-webpconvert) to convert jpg to webp to help improve my score in light house.

 Css grid from [Dcode youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnhoY5Cdmy0)

# Testing
Used a temporary red background-color in css to test my css links when setting up my Html.

I had an issue with header h1 position. I removed float left with chrome dev tools and used posisiton fixed and z-index to fix the header.

Issue with navigation links not going to top right of the page - Fixed by adjusting the margin.

Images in Discography differnt sizes. I fixed this with windows photos using the resize option.

The Header and navigation would overlap discography. I fixed this with chrome dev tools by adding margin and padding top.

The pictures were not the right sizes. I chrome dev tools to adjust sizing of pictures in the grid for the discography.

Media screen and max width created a space in tablet view. I fixed by adjusting width to 100%

Lighthouse score for mobile was 80, I converted the jpg files to webp and it increased my score to 86. 

Removed "/" from /assets/css/style.css to assets/css/style.css so git pages would work.

Removed background image from a webp to a jpg for a better image quality. Changed [Cult-called-man-band.webp](assets/images/cult-called-man-band.webp) to [Cult-Called-man-band.jpg](assets/images/cult-called-man-band.jpg)

Tested Using Samsung Galaxy 8+, Iphone pro 12, Iphone XR, Ipad Air and Ipad Mini

Current Lighthouse results for desktop.
