# **Planning stage**
## Target Audiences:
* Users looking for new music from Ireland.
* Users with a general interest in Cult Called Man and want to learn more.
* Users who have never heard of Cult Called Man.
* Users who have heard of Cult Called Man but would like to find more information.

## User Experience
* As a site user, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site and find the information I am looking for. 
* As a site user, I want to be able to view the site on all my devices.
* As a site user, I want to be satisfied with the information provided.
* As a site user, I want to be able to find contact information.
* As a site user, I want to be able to find social media links easily.

## Site Aims:
* To educate the user on Cult Called Man's music.
* To offer the user a chance to listen to the band.
* To offer the user a way to contact the site author for further information or discussion.
* To offer a way to analyse which album is fans favorite.

## How Is This Will Be Achieved:
* The index page provides the user with a summary of the band, with a way to listen to the bands music and a way to contact them. I will also include a check box to find out which is there most popular album.

* The site will provide free ways to listen to there music with links to there bandcamp and spotify so users can listen to their music.

* The site will have information on the type of band this is and genre of music they play. It will have their music playing on the website with a video.

# Strategy
 I want to have a place were fans and newbies can get all of the bands music in one place as they are found on different websites online. I want to tell people of my favorite Irish band and let them listen to them and if they wanted they can sign up for a gig guide that would be sent to there email.

I want to achieve an easy and convient place for people to find all of the bands music. I want to tell people of there music by having a discography, so the user can click and have there music. I will be using the bands bandcamp website, Spotify and Youtube. I will have there links to social media platforms

With the structure of the site. I will have it in one page for the convenience of the user. This will also be quicker then changing from differnt pages. I will lock the header with a navigation bar that will follow the user across the page so the user can navigate the page easily.

I will present the information by using pictures and video. This way the user can see the type of band they are listening too. I will be using the theme of there Cult Fiction album across the page as they are bright colours that contrast nicely and are easy to look at from a users perspective. Cult Fiction is also there most popular album so it may be recognisable to users who are fans of the band already.
