# Cult Called Man
My website [live here](https://)

## Project Portfolio 1- HTML and CSS Essentials - Code Institute.

The project will cover  my favorite music group.
Its aim is to highlight there music and social media presence.

The idea of the project is to showcase there music to fans and newbies while making it as user friendly as I can.
Cult Called Man an Irish retro pop rock group. I want to have a place were fans and newbies can get all of the bands music in one place as they are found on different websites online. I want to tell people of my favorite Irish band and let them listen to them and if they wanted they can sign up for a gig guide that would be sent to there email.

I want to achieve an easy and convient place for people to find all of the bands music. I want to tell people of there music by having a discography, so the user can click and have there music. I will be using the bands bandcamp website, Spotify and Youtube. I will have there links to social media platforms

With the structure of the site. I will have it in one page for the convenience of the user. This will also be quicker then changing from differnt pages. I will lock the header with a navigation bar that will follow the user across the page so the user can navigate the page easily.

I will present the information by using pictures and video. This way the user can see the type of band they are listening too. I will be using the theme of there Cult Fiction album across the page as they are bright colours that contrast nicely and are easy to look at from a users perspective. Cult Fiction is also there most popular album so it may be recognisable to users who are fans of the band already.
