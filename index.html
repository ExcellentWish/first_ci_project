            <p>With their debut album on the horizon, the summer festival season looming ahead and global conquest on their minds, 2016 will be a seminal year for Cult Called Man.<br>
                The art rock quintet have always held an appreciation for the strange side of the human condition. <br>‘When we play, it's a church. We preach, and people either get on board or get freaked out.' </p>

            <p>With their second album on the horizon for 2019, Cult Called Man are set to bring retro-pop to the mainstream. <br>
                Sad but upbeat, simple but never ordinary.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Hailing from Ratoath in God’s own country (County Meath), on initial listen the quintet’s sound may recall some of the quirky, experimental post-punk groups of the late ’70s and early ’80s,<br>
                    such as Talking Heads and Devo, but there is no doubt that the band has evolved away from mere imitation, creating something that is distinctly their own.</p>
            </div>   
            
            <div>
                <p>
                    In the words of the band themselves, <br>
                    “Cult Called Man are more than just a band. They are a gathering. A legion. A cult.” Singularly devoted to their craft,
                    <br> they act as pseudo-preachers, inciting inspiration and divination on their growing congregation.
