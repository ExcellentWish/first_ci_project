## This was orginally a txt document I had questions to my mentor and some ideas for portfolio project 1 ##

1.2Design a website that meets accessibility guidelines (e.g. contrast between background and
foreground colors, non-text elements have planned alt text equivalents to cater for the visually
impaired)
-Include alt in images and aria +aria labelledby (to describe what the link or section is)? readabilty, clear not clutered 

1.3 Design the organisation of information on the page following the principles of user experience
design (headers are used to convey structure, information is easy to find due to being
presented and categorised in terms of priority)-
Is this using hearders , main, sections , articles and footers? hirachy 

1.5Include graphics that are consistent in style and colour-
Is this like contrast in 1.2 -easy to read or  images and videos, or animation like love running img forward- themes - consistant-follow same

2.1
Create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) at least 3 separate
page areas, to match the design and to meet its stated purpose-
Which is more industry standerd now? A continues scrolling page or 3 seprate pages? Or is it a content issue?

2.6Use CSS media queries or CSS Grid/Bootstrap across the application to ensure the layout
changes appropriately and maintains the page's structural integrity across device screen sizes

Is this the meta viewport device width scale code? or @media screen and (max-width: x) -css flex box 2d grid 3d

2.7Use Semantic markup to structure HTML code
Again like 1.3 have headers sections asides footers articles?

3
Have the code and files readable, have comments for external sources , comments on code to help explain it aswell. 
and a read me that explaines it as well

4.3 Use consistent and effective markdown formatting to produce a README file that is
well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors
Continue to updated the readme file?

5.1 Design and implement manual testing procedures to assess functionality, usability and
responsiveness.
This is for chrome dev tools? Changing it to a mobile device to see if it works ok? no errors F2
